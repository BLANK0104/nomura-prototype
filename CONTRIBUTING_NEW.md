- Add proper JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Example component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Define all props with proper types
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // State management
  // Effect hooks
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
};

export default Component;
```
