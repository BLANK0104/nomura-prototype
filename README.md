## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Implement functional components with React hooks
- Utilize TypeScript interfaces for comprehensive type safety
- Follow clean code principles with consistent naming conventions
- Create reusable components to minimize code duplication
- Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Maintain consistent code formatting and documentation

### Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: All components use modern React hooks
- **TypeScript Integration**: Complete type safety throughout the application
- **Material-UI Integration**: Consistent use of MUI components and theming
